# ML-Models-from-Scratch
Repo for ML Models  built from scratch. Includes Linear and Logistic Regression, PCA, LDA etc

This code contains the traditional and simpole ML models built using `numpy`, `pandas` and `python 3` only. There might be some issues but will be solved over time. Not the best of the models but gives good understanding of the problems and helps in deep understanding of the concepts.
